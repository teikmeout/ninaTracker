## User Case
1. Mary is an everyday consumer that wants to know how much to budget for her monthly marihuana budget. Mary opens our app and for a couple of weeks logs each of her marihuana purchases with weight and cost by provider. This helps the app project how much Mary consumes daily and how frequently she buys. The application will project the correct amount depending on the users purchase behaviours.  
2. Fernando is a light user that wants to have party at his place but wants to split the cost of marihuana between his friends, he opens our app, introduces his purchase history and includes in the list all the poeple that will be taking part of this purchase. Those people will be notified about what kind of marihuana Fernando is purchasing and how much they will chip in for this event.
